This is the flutter project for [Talk Dim Sum](http://talkdimsum.com) (the JSON and image assets are maintained separately in that repo, and you can download the latest Android and macOS builds there).

The Swift version on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talk-dim-sum/id953929066) has more features and polish than the Android build from this project but shares the same data.

## Publishing

The Android build was on Google Play for a while but it's not really worth the hassle (tons of spam from the email address you're required to list, and for some reason I've found on Google Play there are more whiny reviews from people who act like they paid for the app), and I've considered F-Droid, but they have a history with [Aptoide](https://f-droid.org/en/about/) which I find repugnant. But this is open source, so anyone can fork and publish builds, but of course I'd appreciate an attribution. And the code will require some updating if you want to use the latest data.
