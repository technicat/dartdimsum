This is the flutter project for [Talk Dim Sum](http://talkdimsum.com) (the JSON and image assets are maintained separately in that repo, and you can download Android and macOS builds there).

The Swift version on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/talk-dim-sum/id953929066) has more features and polish than the Android build from this project but shares the same data.
